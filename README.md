# web3sdks Unity Templates

This repository contains templates for creating new Unity projects with our [Unity SDK](https://github.com/web3sdks/unity-sdk).

Each folder contains a Unity project with a `README.md` file that explains what the template is for and how to use it.

## How To Use This Repo

Each folder contains a `.unitypackage` that contains the required files for the template, which you can import into your Unity project.

You can import this package into your Unity project by going to `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...` and selecting the `.unitypackage` file.
